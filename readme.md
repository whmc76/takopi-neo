# takopi

🐙 *he just wants to help-pi*

telegram bridge for codex, claude code, opencode, pi. manage multiple projects and worktrees, stream progress, and resume sessions anywhere.

## features

- projects and worktrees: work on multiple repos/branches simultaneously, branches are git worktrees
- stateless resume: continue in chat or copy the resume line to pick up in terminal
- progress streaming: commands, tools, file changes, elapsed time
- parallel runs across agent sessions, per-agent-session queue
- works with telegram features like voice notes and scheduled messages
- file transfer: send files to the repo or fetch files/dirs back
- group chats and topics: map group topics to repo/branch contexts
- works with existing anthropic and openai subscriptions

## requirements

`uv` for installation (`curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh`)

python 3.14+ (`uv python install 3.14`)

at least one engine on PATH: `codex`, `claude`, `opencode`, or `pi`

## install

```sh
uv tool install -U takopi
```

## setup

run `takopi` and follow the setup wizard. it will help you:

1. create a bot token via @BotFather
2. pick a workflow (assistant, workspace, or handoff)
3. connect your chat
4. choose a default engine

workflows configure conversation mode, topics, and resume lines automatically:

- **assistant**: ongoing chat with auto-resume (recommended)
- **workspace**: forum topics bound to repos/branches
- **handoff**: reply-to-continue with terminal resume lines

## usage

```sh
cd ~/dev/happy-gadgets
takopi
```

on windows during local development, you can also double-click [`start-takopi.bat`](start-takopi.bat) or run `start-takopi.bat` from `cmd`/powershell. it starts takopi from the repo root and asks `uv` for python 3.14 first.

send a message to your bot. prefix with `/codex`, `/claude`, `/opencode`, or `/pi` to pick an engine. reply to continue a thread.

register a project with `takopi init happy-gadgets`, then target it from anywhere with `/happy-gadgets hard reset the timeline`.

mention a branch to run an agent in a dedicated worktree `/happy-gadgets @feat/memory-box freeze artifacts forever`.

send `/help` in Telegram for the active command set. see [`docs/how-to/commands.md`](docs/how-to/commands.md) for the full command and directive guide.

inspect or update settings with `takopi config list`, `takopi config get`, and `takopi config set`.

see [takopi.dev](https://takopi.dev/) for configuration, worktrees, topics, file transfer, and more.
